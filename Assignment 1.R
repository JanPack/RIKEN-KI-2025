#1.2a: Medical Relevant insights
#This paper analyses the development of Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) in human
#embryos at post-conception weeks 8-10. Oligodendrocytes play a vital role in the
#proper function of the human brain, as they are responsible for forming the 
#myelin sheath around myelinated axons. It is important to fully understand the
#characteristics of OPCs as a deficiency can lead to developmental errors as well
#as diseases later in life such as multiple sclerosis. In this paper, the authors
#found a "wave" of OPC development that was known in mice but not in humans and 
#indicates an earlier development of OPCs than previously assumed.

#1.2b: genomic technologies:
#The main technologies of this paper are single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell 
#ATAC-seq, and in-situ sequencing/hybridization. With this data they can inferments
#of the developmental trajectory of OPCs and other cell types in the brain.

#1.3a: extending the analysis
#To extend the analysis, I would like to look at following three points:
#A: How exactly is the chromatin remodeled prior to oligodendrogenesis?
#B: How are the developmental "waves" triggered, and what determines their timing?
#C: How are errors in this developmental stage related to diseases later in life?

#1.3b: As the chromatin remodeling would occur previous to the timepoint of the 
#data analysis of the paper, the responsible proteins are likely not expressed
#anymore. To overcome this, maybe the protein activity could be plotted from mouse
#data first, and see if there are any remodelers that are still expressed even after
#the pre-oligodendrogenesis preparation is completed. Those proteins could then be 
#looked for in the scRNA data of the human cells. A similar process where mouse 
#data is consulted first could be used for elucidating the wave triggers.
#As for disease causing errors, public databases such as UKbiobank could be consulted
#to see if there is a correlation with mutations in the transcription factors 
#detected in this study with disorders.
